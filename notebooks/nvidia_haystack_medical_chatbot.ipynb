SARS-CoV-2 vaccines created an opportunity for new insights in vaccine timing because patients were challenged with a novel antigen across multiple phases of treatment. We studied serologic mRNA vaccine response in retrospective and prospective cohorts with lymphoma and CLL, paired with clinical and research immune parameters. Reduced serologic response was observed more frequently during active therapies, but non-response was also common within observation and post-treatment groups. Total IgA and IgM correlated with successful vaccine response. In individuals treated with CART-19, non-response was associated with reduced B and T follicular helper cells. Predictors of vaccine response varied by disease and therapeutic group, and therefore further studies of immune health during and after cancer therapies are needed to allow individualized vaccine timing.\",\n",

In this case, patients with lymphoma and CLL were studied for their serologic mRNA vaccine response, and researchers found that the timing of vaccination relative to therapy was an important factor in determining the effectiveness of the vaccine. Additionally, researchers identified immune parameters that correlated with successful vaccine response, such as total IgA and IgM. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal timing of vaccination during and after cancer therapies to allow for individualized vaccine timing and improved outcomes for patients.'], 'meta': [{'role': 'assistant', 'finish_reason': 'stop'}], 'usage': {'completion_tokens': 178, 'prompt_tokens': 444, 'total_tokens': 622}}}\n"
